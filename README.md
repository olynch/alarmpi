#Alarm Pi

I don't have a smartphone for the next few weeks, but I need an alarm clock that wakes me up with music. Therefore, I needed to use my raspberry pi. This meteor app allows you to configure playlists of songs from youtube to play at different times.

# Todo

[x] Write the UI for configuring the settings in the database
[ ] Write the backend code to read the database and play the songs at the right time
[ ] Write more UI for snooze/turn off functions (maybe hook up physical button with arduino?)
[ ] Set up the raspberry pi to automatically start up everything when it boots
